This is a Book Recommendation System.

data sets are used from GoodReads  link > https://mengtingwan.github.io/data/goodreads.html
from the website you need to download just 2 datasets for this project.

1. goodreads_books.json.gz ( for now it is of 2gb)  this is available under meta-data of books
2. goodreads_reviews_dedup.json.gz ( for now it is of 5gb) this is available under Book reviews

this system is built by using these techniques:

1) Basic cut
     > Top 50 books with best book_average_rating
     > Top 50 concised books
     > Top 50 e-books
     > Books having similar book title

     > Books that got similar review
     > Books where user choice's match
     > 
2) Similar cover-page of books

3) Correlation-based recommender system
